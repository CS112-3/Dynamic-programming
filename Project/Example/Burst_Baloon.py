"""Burst Balloon
Try bursting every available balloon.
Imagine there are only three balloons remaining: left, i, right. At this state,
    1) we have already burst balloon from left to i --> remaining left
    2) we haven't touch i
    3) we have already burst balloon from i to right --> remaining right
If we go ahead and burst balloon i,
    - we'll collect nums[i] * nums[left] * nums[right] coins as specified in the problem statement
    - we'll also collect coins from bursting left to i, since we've burst them previously --> see 1)
    - plus coins from bursting i to right --> see 2)
