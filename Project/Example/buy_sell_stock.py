Define two states to keep track of max profit so far:
    - buy, max profit so far, last transaction is buy
    - sell, max profit so far, last transaction is sell
buy[i] means we buy today, the max profit is buy[i].
sell[i] means we sell today, the max profit is sell[i].
Thus,
    - buy[i] = max(sell[i - 2] - price, buy[i - 1])
      -- sell the day before since we can't sell yesterday,
      -- or do nothing (carry over the profit from yesterday's buy: buy[i - 1])
    - sell[i] = max(buy[i - 1] + price, sell[i - 1])
      -- in order to sell today, we can buy yesterday so buy[i - 1] is allowed,
      -- or do nothing (sell[i - 1])
